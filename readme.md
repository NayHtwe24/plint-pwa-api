# Project description
This repository contains a Laravel installation that is only used as an API backend for
a [Vue PWA](https://github.com/pimhooghiemstra/plintpwa-vue-1) we are developing in a blog series. You can read more on our [blog](https://www.blog.plint-sites.nl)
or on [Medium](https://medium.com/plint-sites).

The sample app we'll build is really simple but on the backend we'll use the [Webpush notification channel package](https://github.com/laravel-notification-channels/webpush). This needs some setup and configuration.
