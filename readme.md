#Project description
This repository contains a Laravel installation that is only used as an API backend for
a Vue PWA we are developing in a blog series. You can read more on our [blog](https://www.blog.plint-sites.nl)
or on [Medium](https://medium.com/plint-sites).

The sample app we'll build is really simple but on the backend we'll use the [Webpush notification channel package](https://github.com/laravel-notification-channels/webpush). This needs some setup and configuration.

The code in this repo reflects a specific post in the series. We'll make releases with consistent numbering. The current version (no tag yet as of November 7, 2018) is ready for part 2 of the series I am still writing.
